### Hackathon-Presentation

## Rigol'App

<p>Let me introduce you to my first Hackathon after two month as a web developer student.</p>

<p>⏱️ Develop in 36 hours, we have been a group of five to build this project.</p>

<p>🍀 The theme of the hackathon was "Deconnexion and Nature" !</p>

<p>💡 We wanted to create something funny on a subject we usually have fun on it.</p>

<p>🖇️ And also prove that we can build a serious project even if we didn't know anything on the subject we choosed.</p>

<p>🧘 We had the idea of making a application based on something called in french "Yoga du rire", "Laughter Yoga".</p>
